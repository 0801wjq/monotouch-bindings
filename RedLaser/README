RedLaser
========

This is a MonoTouch binding for the RedLaser Library which can be found at

     http://redlaser.com/sdk/index.php


Building
========

To build the bindings, run the `make` command from within the bindings
directory.


Using RedLaser.dll with your own iOS App
=======================================

Simply add RedLaser.dll to your project's References in MonoDevelop and you are
good to go!

If you want to profit from the size reductions with the static registrar, you
also need to add --dlsym:false to the additional mtouch arguments in the
project's iOS Build options.
