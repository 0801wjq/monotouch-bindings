CorePlot
========

Binding to the CorePlot open source library for MonoTouch and MonoMac.

	iOS Warning: this wont build with the released MonoTouch (as
	of January 1st 2011), as it requires a couple of changes to
	the base libraries to bind a few routines (it uses
	constructors that were flagged as internal in MonoTouch that
	should have been public).

You can use the binaries provided in the meantime.

To build from source:

	For iOS:
	   make ios
	
	For OSX:
	   make osx
